Introduction
===============

The Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is a highly-efficient, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can work on numerical and categorical data types. This repository contains the code of CCC and instructions to install and use it. It also has all the scripts/notebooks to run the analyses associated with the manuscript, where we applied CCC on gene expression data.

CCC-GPU is a GPU-accelerated version of CCC that can work on large datasets. It now supports the CUDA backend.
